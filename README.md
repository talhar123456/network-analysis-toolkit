# network-analysis-toolkit
Includes tools for creating and visualizing networks, computing degree distributions, and comparing these distributions to the Poisson distribution.

## Overview

Welcome to the **network-analysis-toolkit** repository! This project provides a set of Python classes and functions designed for constructing, analyzing, and visualizing random networks. It includes tools to create various network structures, compute degree distributions, and compare these distributions with theoretical models such as the Poisson distribution.

## Features

- **Network Construction:** Build and manage network structures using custom Node and Network classes.
- **Random Network Generation:** Generate random, undirected networks with specified parameters.
- **Degree Distribution Analysis:** Compute and visualize the degree distribution of networks.
- **Poisson Distribution Comparison:** Compare network degree distributions to the Poisson distribution to assess randomness.

## Getting Started

To get started with this toolkit, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NetworkAnalysisToolkit.git
